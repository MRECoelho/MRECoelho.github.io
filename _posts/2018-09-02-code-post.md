Chalk uses the default Jekyll syntax highlighting gem Rouge. It has a customized style for both light and dark theme.
Use the `highlight` tag to use the following code highlighting your preferred language:

```javascript
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```


```rust
fn rust(){

    let btm: BTreeMap<i64, &str> = BTreeMap::new();
}
```

```python
def python():
  return 10
```

## Headings

Chalk includes 3 headings by default:

## Heading first level
### Heading second level
#### Heading third level
